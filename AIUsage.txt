Hey professor/grader!

Just wanted to inform you that I used generative AI in my project for the GenerateRandomBigInteger function
near the end of my code. I was originally going to use the build in Random rand in C#, but that only
works for integers, and not BigIntergers. ChatGPT gave me the idea and help to implement this function
that instead of generating a number, it randomly generated bytes to create a BigInteger.
